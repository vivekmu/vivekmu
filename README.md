# 👋 Hey there, I'm Vivek Murugesan!

I'm a solution-driven engineer with a passion for building scalable systems, simplifying complex Kubernetes environments and automate cloud infrastructure provisioning using Terraform and CI/CD pipelines.

Having experience across manufacturing, finance, and enterprise platforms, I've worked with teams navigating container orchestration chaos, infrastructure drift, and fragile deployments. My mission? Deliver stability, performance, and elegance.
